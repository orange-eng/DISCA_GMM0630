# DISCA_GMM

This repository uses pyotrch to reproduce DISCA_GMM_CAVI.

It's based on the tf version of DISCA_GMM, so I do not remove the original tf files.

torch_DISCA_gmmu.py is equal to DISCA_gmmu_cavi_llh_scanning_new.py, and it can run smoothly.

Now, I am working for torch_DISCA_gmmuv2.py, which is equal to disca_gmmu_cavi_llh_hist_new.py.
